# Pathfinding
Optimal Pathfinding Application with Graphical Navigator
Programmed a gamified pathfinding application using a graphical grid with obstacles and weights, achieving up to
12% faster search performance by refining the heuristic function.
Executed A* and Dijkstra’s algorithms, boosting the model’s acceleration by 10%. Users can select start and end
points, add obstacles, and visually track the pathfinding process through a dynamic graphical interface.
